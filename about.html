                <p>Shortly before Harry's eleventh birthday, he receives a letter addressed specifically to him. His
                    outraged uncle, however, reads and burns it before Harry has a chance to look at the contents. The
                    sender does not give up, and the Dursleys receive successively larger numbers of the same
                    correspondence. Soon, his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) becomes so paranoid that the Dursleys,
                    with Harry in tow, hide in a hut on a small island to escape. That night (which happens to be before
                    Harry's birthday), he is visited by an enormous man named Hagrid who bursts through the locked door
                    of the hut. With Hagrid holding the Dursleys at bay, Harry finally reads his letter, in which he
                    learns he has been invited to study magic at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The next
                    day Harry and Hagrid head to Diagon Alley in London (the secret magical location hidden behind the
                    famous wizarding pub The Leaky Cauldron). Harry enters the wizarding world for the first time,
                    learns to his surprise that he is famous, and meets the new Hogwarts Defense Against the Dark Arts
                    teacher, Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart). Hagrid takes Harry to Gringott's Bank, where Harry learns
                    that he is quite wealthy. Following this, Hagrid stops at a different vault to retrieve a small,
                    wrapped parcel for Dumbledore.</p>

                <p> Using his newfound money, Harry buys everything he requires for his first school year, including and
                    owl, and a wand. Interestingly, the wand that chooses him is the brother wand of the one that was
                    used to kill Harry's parents and give him the scar. He then takes the train to Hogwarts from
                    Platform Nine and three-quarters, befriending Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and meeting Hermione
                    Granger (Emma Watson), a Muggle-born witch.</p>
